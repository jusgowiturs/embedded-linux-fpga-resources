# 01 - Environment Setup

This is the first stage of the lab. By the end of it you will have the
toolchain installed, the repository checked out, and a shell with the
environment variables that the later stages depend on.

## Board and part information

- **Zynq**: A family of FPGAs from Xilinx (AMD) that also contain an ARM
  processor built into them. The ARM processor is a *hard IP* (hard macro)
  because it is designed directly into the chip and supports only limited
  configuration.
- **PS** (Processing System): the ARM processor. You can configure aspects
  such as the clock and interrupt connections, but the instruction set, bus
  width etc. are fixed.
- **PL** (Programmable Logic): the FPGA fabric - lookup tables (LUTs),
  flip-flops (FFs), block RAM (BRAM) and DSP slices (multipliers, not used
  here).
- **Pynq**: an Open Source software framework (Python libraries plus a Linux
  distribution) for talking to hardware on the board. We do not use the Pynq
  software stack itself, but we start from the Pynq SD card image.

The lab uses a **Pynq-Z1** or **Pynq-Z2** board (both are available and both
work). Key facts:

- **Part number**: `XC7Z020CLG400-1`. Zynq XC7Z family, the 020 device (second
  smallest), CLG400 package (400 pins), `-1` speed grade (slowest - anything
  that works here works on faster grades). You need this exact part when you
  create a Vivado project.
- **XDC file**: you map some outputs to the on-board LEDs. The LED pin
  locations are fixed by the board designer, so you cannot choose arbitrary
  pins. The Pynq-Z1 XDC is in this repo as [pynq-z1.xdc](../pynq-z1.xdc) (for
  the Z2, get its XDC from the Pynq website). Use only the pins you need. The
  IO standard for the LEDs is `LVCMOS33` (3.3V CMOS).

## System requirements

These instructions are tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04 (both work). The lab
machines already have the Xilinx tools installed.

- **Vivado 2021.1** if you are setting up your own machine (this is the tested
  version). Newer versions should work for these simple designs but are not
  tested.
- On recent Ubuntu the Vivado GUI usually needs the `libtinfo5` package, which
  is not installed by default.
- At least **8 GB RAM** (16 GB preferred - Vivado struggles at 8 GB), and
  **10-20 GB** of free disk on top of the Vivado install.

The board boots from an SD card. Flash the standard Pynq base image to the SD
card first: we will only replace the `image.ub` file on partition 1, so you
need to start from a working card. Flashing the base image is not covered here.

## Required packages

The lab machines already have everything installed, and no lab step needs
`sudo`. The list below is for setting up your own Ubuntu machine.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install curl

# Device tree compiler (used to build the DTB for the boot image)
sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler

# ARM cross-compilation toolchain
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf

# Build essentials
sudo apt-get install build-essential flex bison libssl-dev libelf-dev cmake git

# U-Boot tools (provides mkimage / dumpimage for the boot image)
sudo apt-get install u-boot-tools

# Serial terminal for the board console
sudo apt-get install picocom
# Let your user open the serial port (log out and in afterwards)
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
```

## Repository checkout and environment

All later steps assume you have checked out the repository and are working
inside `labs`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bsc-iitm/embedded-linux-fpga-resources.git
cd embedded-linux-fpga-resources/labs
# Open a new shell with the lab environment set up
./setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` exports the variables used throughout the lab and drops you into a
fresh shell:

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `ARCH` | `arm` |
| `CROSS_COMPILE` | `arm-linux-gnueabihf-` |
| `LDIR` | the `labs` folder |
| `DL` | the `labs/downloads` folder |
| `KDIR` | kernel source/build dir (`$DL/linux-6.6`) |
| `BDIR` | busybox source dir (`$DL/busybox-1.32.0`) |

`setup.sh` only sets up the shell it opens. **In every new terminal, `cd` to
`labs` and run `./setup.sh` again.** Without it, `make` in the kernel folder
quietly reconfigures the kernel for your PC instead of the ARM board.

You are welcome to write your own scripts or command sequences instead - the
variables above are just there to keep the later commands short.

Next: [02 - Kernel and boot image](./02-kernel-and-boot-image.md).
