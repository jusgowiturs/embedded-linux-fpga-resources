# Downloads Directory

This folder holds the things you download and build for the lab: the busybox
and Linux kernel sources, plus the known-good build configs that ship with it
(`config-busybox` and `config-linux`).

Before doing this, follow [01 - Environment setup](../docs/01-environment-setup.md)
and run `setup.sh`. The commands below assume the variables it exports (`DL`,
`KDIR`, `BDIR`, `LDIR`, ...) are set.

## Required Downloads

### Busybox Source

Download busybox for creating the initramfs:

```bash
cd $DL
wget https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.32.0.tar.bz2
# If busybox.net is down, a mirror:
# wget https://launchpad.net/busybox/main/1.32.0/+download/busybox-1.32.0.tar.bz2
tar -xf busybox-1.32.0.tar.bz2
```

#### Configure and build busybox

It is important that you do this before trying to compile the kernel since the
kernel looks for the `/tmp/initramfs` folder and the
`/tmp/initramfs.devnodes` file, and the build will fail without them.

```bash
cd busybox-1.32.0
# Copy in a known good config - there are some issues with some packages like `tc`
cp $DL/config-busybox .config
# Set up some include files etc for compilation - if there are any questions just
# accept the defaults for the new settings.
make oldconfig
# You can use `-j$(nproc)` to run fully parallel if you have enough RAM
# `-j4` means use 4 processors, which is a safer option to avoid running out of memory
make -j4 CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- install CONFIG_PREFIX=/tmp/initramfs
```

#### Set up the init script

For the kernel to actually give you a shell interface to type commands, you need
to make some additional files in the initramfs.  To do this, run the following
commands:

```bash
cd $LDIR
./initramfs-setup.sh
```

Now you can compile the kernel and it should result in a bootable kernel image.

### Linux Kernel Source

Download the Linux kernel source (version 6.6 recommended):

```bash
cd $DL
wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/linux-6.6.tar.xz
tar -xf linux-6.6.tar.xz
```

#### Configure and build kernel

```bash
cd linux-6.6
# Copy a known good config
# Otherwise you can go through `make defconfig` etc but there are a lot
# of params that change from one version to another.
cp $DL/config-linux .config
# make oldconfig sets up scripts required for compiling
make oldconfig
# Replace 4 with a suitable number depending on the number of cores in your system
make -j4
```

Once this is done, there should be a kernel in `$KDIR/arch/arm/boot/zImage`. You
will use this later to build a boot image to put on the SD card.

## Directory Structure

Expected structure after setup (everything self-contained under `labs`):

```
labs/downloads/
├── config-busybox          # Known-good busybox config (tracked)
├── config-linux            # Known-good kernel config (tracked)
├── busybox-1.32.0/         # Busybox source (you download and build)
│   └── ...
├── linux-6.6/              # Kernel source (you download and build)
│   ├── arch/arm/boot/zImage   # Built kernel
│   └── ...
└── README.md               # This file
```

Note: The `.gitignore` in this directory keeps the large downloaded sources and
build artifacts out of git; the two config files and this README are tracked.
